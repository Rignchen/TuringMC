- Foreach:\
The `foreach` function is used to iterate through a list of elements.\
Syntax: `function turing:_turing/loop/foreach.mcfunction {array: <list_values>, fn: <function_name>}`\
Output: call the function you asked for as a macro with the current element called `item`
- Foreach with Referece:\
The `foreach_ref` function is used to iterate through a list of elements from the data of a block, entity or storage.\
