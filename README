# Turing Mc
Turing Mc is a minecraft datapack that adds usual programming functions to minecraft

## Installation
1. Download the latest release for your minecraft version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Rignchen/Turing-Mc/releases)
2. Put the downloaded file into the `datapacks` folder of your world
3. Run `/reload` in your world

## Usage
To use Turing Mc, you need to create another datapack, in this datapack, you can use the functions provided by Turing Mc while creating your datapack.

- Foreach:\
The `foreach` function is used to iterate through a list of elements.\
Syntax: `function turing:_turing/loop/foreach.mcfunction {array: <list_values>, fn: <function_name>}`\
Output: call the function you asked for as a macro with the current element called `item`
- Foreach with Referece:\
The `foreach_ref` function is used to iterate through a list of elements from the data of a block, entity or storage.\
Syntax: `function turing:_turing/loop/foreach_ref.mcfunction {ref: <reference_to_data>, fn: <function_name>}`\
Output: call the function you asked for as a macro with the current element called `item`
- For:\
The `for` function is used to iterate through a range of numbers.\
Syntax: `function turing:_turing/loop/for.mcfunction {start: <start_value>, end: <end_value>, step: <step_value>, var: <variable_name>, fn: <function_name>}`\
Output: call the function you asked for with the number inside the score `<variable_name> turing.out`\
Note: the start value is included but not the end value
